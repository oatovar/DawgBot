# DawgBot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oatovar/DawgBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oatovar/DawgBot)

DawgBot is a discord chatbot that likes to have fun. It's fun and aims to bring fun to your guild whether it's through memes or adorable anime pictures. DawgBot is a side project and I try to actively work on it whenever I can. If you have any feature requests, please feel free to add an issue and I will attempt to add it as quickly as I can. Likewise, if there's a bug I will attempt to fix it as soon as I can, but ask that you please help me by filing an issue.

Lastly, this project could not occur (or would take a loooot more effort) without the help of the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) project. Shoutout to them for all their hardwork.
